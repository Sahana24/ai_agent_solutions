# English Accent Classifier

üîó **Live App**: [Try it on Streamlit Cloud](https://aiagentsolutions-ae7mq89xptagsiou6t4czc.streamlit.app/)

## What Is This?

This tool helps evaluate the spoken English proficiency of candidates for hiring or screening purposes. It analyzes the speaker‚Äôs voice from a public video and estimates their English accent, along with a confidence score and visual summary.

## Features

- **Video Input:** Accepts public video URLs (Loom, YouTube, or direct MP4 links).
- **Audio Extraction:** Converts video to audio using ffmpeg.
- **Language Check:** Uses OpenAI Whisper to check if the audio is in English.
- **Accent Classification:** Compares the speaker's voice to a set of reference accents (British, American, Australian, etc.) using SpeechBrain embeddings.
- **Confidence Scoring:** Provides a confidence score (0‚Äì100%) for the detected accent.
- **User-Friendly UI:** Built with Streamlit for easy testing and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- FFmpeg installed on your system
  - Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
  - Make sure it's added to your system PATH

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sahana24/ai_agent_solutions.git
   cd ai_agent_solutions
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Paste a public video URL into the input field (YouTube, Loom, or direct .mp4 link).
3. Click Run Analysis.
4. View the results:
   - Detected accent
   - Confidence score
   - Short explanation
   - Bar chart of accent confidence scores

## Dataset

The tool uses a curated set of reference audio clips from the **[Common Voice Corpus 21.0 (English)](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets)** developed by Mozilla. This is a large, open-source, multilingual dataset containing voice recordings from diverse speakers around the world.

For this project, we selected samples labeled with the following English accents:
- **American (United States English)**
- **British (England English)**
- **Australian English**
- **Indian English**
- **Nigerian English**
- **Canadian English**
- **Scottish English**

Each accent category contains up to **1-3 validated audio clips** (in `.mp3` format), which are converted to **16kHz mono `.wav` files** and stored in the `reference_accents/` directory. These clips serve as **reference anchors** for accent comparison.

We use **SpeechBrain's pre-trained speaker embedding model** (`ecapa-tdnn`) to convert these clips into fixed-size vector embeddings. During analysis, the speaker's embedding is compared against these reference embeddings using cosine similarity to classify the accent and score the confidence.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some accents may have fewer than 3 available clips in the dataset due to limited contributions for those categories.
